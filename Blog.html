        <h2 id="Soil" style="font-size: 1.5vw;">Soil</h2> by Arianna Reiche
        <p>he drain fly doesn’t move, even when she slaps the wall. It’s alone. To the naked eye he could be a fleck of filth, or a chip in the paint. But Anita knows the tell-tale clover shape and the thing’s unwillingness to move from a threat. They don’t fear death. They don’t know if they’re animal or mineral.
    
    It’s no use trying to deal with one herself. Management had exterminators in, and they were gone from the lobby for a week or two but came back at the start of May. Then management swapped out the hanging plants for standing ones. It was a strategy that all parties seemed extremely...(<a href="https://joylandmagazine.com/fiction/soil/">Read more)</a></p>
    
        <h2 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">Where’s _why?</h2> By Annie Lowrey
        <p>In March 2009, Golan Levin, the director of Carnegie Mellon University’s interdisciplinary STUDIO for Creative Inquiry, invited an enigmatic and famed computer programmer known to the virtual world only as “Why the Lucky Stiff” or  “_why”—no, not a typo—to speak at a CMU conference called Art && Code—also not a typo—an event where artsy nerds and nerdy artists gather to talk shop.

            _why came to Pittsburgh and presented his latest project to a room full of a student programmers and artists. He was scruffily handsome, seemingly in his early- to mid-30s, with shaggy brown hair falling in his eyes and a constant half-smile. He looked like a member of an indie band—he actually was in an indie band—or the leader of an experimental improv troupe...(<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/03/ruby_ruby_on_rails_and__why_the_disappearance_of_one_of_the_world_s_most_beloved_computer_programmers_.single.html">Read more)</a></p>
            <h3 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">The Bitcoin Boy: 16-Year-Old Erik Finman Is in His Silicon Valley Prime</h3> By Benjamin Wallace
            <p>Erik Finman’s parents Paul and Lorna, met at Stanford University in the 1980s, when Paul was getting his Ph.D. in electrical engineering and Lorna was getting hers in physics. Their first date consisted of sitting in her room eating a can of beans. “Our dad is, like, the least romantic person ever,” says Erik, 16. “She had a spectroanalyzer that he wanted.” Paul and Lorna married and eventually moved with their three young sons to Post Falls, Idaho, near where Paul had grown up, and since 9/11, their company, LCF, has prospered, winning lucrative contracts from the Department of Defense to make specialized amplifiers with the ability, among other things, to jam the improvised explosive devices American troops encountered in Iraq...(<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2014/12/bitcoin-boy-erik-finman.html">Read more)</a></p>
        
            <h4 style="font-size: 1.5vw;">How Google Builds Its Maps—and What It Means for the Future of Everything</h4> By Alexis C. Madrigal
            <p>Behind every Google Map, there is a much more complex map that's the key to your queries but hidden from your view. The deep map contains the logic of places: their no-left-turns and freeway on-ramps, speed limits and traffic conditions. This is the data that you're drawing from when you ask Google to navigate you from point A to point B -- and last week, Google showed me the internal map and demonstrated how it was built. It's the first time the company has let anyone watch how the project it calls GT, or "Ground Truth," actually works.

                Google opened up at a key moment in its evolution. The company began as an online search company that made money almost exclusively from selling ads based on what you were querying for. But then the mobile world exploded...(<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/how-google-builds-its-maps-and-what-it-means-for-the-future-of-everything/261913/">Read more)</a></p>

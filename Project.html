The database systems used in hospitals should be capable of holding a significant volume of data and relations as hospitals are frontline where it handles a matter of life and death. The data stored by database systems in hospitals requires more than a lot; information about patients, their guardians, doctors, nurses, diagnosis, and much other minimal information that are closely related. Especially since the beginning of 2020, the world was struck by a COVID-19, which eventually challenged hospitals and their system to the limit. Even countries that are leading global economies, such as the United Kingdom, have failed to control the virus and have dispatched hundreds of their soldiers to move patients and equipment around the hospitals in London (Mueller, 2021). This malicious virus was unbelievably infectious, it has killed over 6,000,000, and it is still ongoing without giving any end in sight for the next ten months (Worldometer, 2022; Charumilind et al., 2022). The hospitals worldwide could not cope with patients due to workforce shortage; a man in Massachusetts, U.S.A, could not get his dialysis and died due to 17 hospitals being incapable of accepting a new patient in January 2022 (Bebinger). Failure to update crucial information can paralyze the whole hospital and its system, leading to small and significant accidents explained before. To prevent any fatal disasters beforehand and from now on, humanity must prepare for future pandemics, so humans' rights and daily lives are guaranteed. To prepare and build a database system that is firm enough to stand against another pandemic, there are prerequisites; all essential functions and information that modern hospital database systems have, accessible interfaces, and user-friendly system for inexperienced people to use, a stable and firm server to hold and save data. The system should be compatible with the current hospital database systems for daily uses. Furthermore, it should be easy to use with basic database query knowledge and experience but provide all vital information.
